### Template to use processing from Java with OpenGL

A minimal template project with gradle build script (and dependencies) to help writing processing code in P3D mode (using OpenGL) in Java.

Pretty straightforward actually, except that the OpenGL dependencies had to be added besides the processing core dependency.

Run with `gradle run`, compile with `gradle jar`, or just import build.gradle to your favorite ide.
